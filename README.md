# gpu-graph-coloring
CUDA implementation of some heuristic parallel graph coloring algorithms as given in the paper titled "Graph Coloring on the GPU and Some Techniques to Improve Load Imbalance" by Shuai Che, Gregory Rodgers, Brad Beckmann and Steve Reinhardt in 2015 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshop.

The CUDA code can parse the .col files of instances given in the below resource as graph input:
https://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances.html

The input.txt file is one such instance.
